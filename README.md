# EduHub

EduHub is an app which will help students find teachers for tutoring. I built this app as part of HackerEarth Ctrl Alt Debt by CredAvenue

## Motivation
With the pandemic growing around us it is not possible to go to mentors physically to get our doubts solved. 
So, in these times mobiles have become a very important part of imparting education and reaching to students who don’t live in the same city or 
even the same country as the mentor. A difficulty which students face is to find good teachers. So this app will help learners find guides as per their 
subject choice and standard.
